Notification Client-side Rules

== Recurring Pickup Request ==

RA Actions:
	a) Claims
		- use transaction: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write#save_data_as_transactions
		- set `claimed` to raId and remove `requested` or `pending`
			- if someone else claimed it, display a sorry msg rather than "claimed" msg.

	b) Rejects
		- remove raId from `requested` or `pending`

	- For both: remove notification from account
